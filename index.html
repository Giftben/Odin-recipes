        Macaroni and cheese—also called mac and cheese in the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat. Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix.The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food. I'm perfectly happy with plain mac and cheese, but we've got variations packed with flavorful mix-ins like bacon, chicken, black beans, and spinach. If you're more into baked mac and cheese, we've got you covered, too. We've even got a few surprises!
