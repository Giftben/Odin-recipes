    <h3 class="heading3"> Description</h3>
    This recipe uses bacon  along with chopped pimentosâ€”if you've ever wanted an excuse to eat pimento cheese with a fork, this is it. Instead of strips, we like to use slab bacon cut into thick, slightly chewy lardons.

    <ul>
        <li> 2 teaspoons cornstarch </li>
        <li> 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
